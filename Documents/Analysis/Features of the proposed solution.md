- ISSAC - Describe the essential features of a computational solution, and explain these  choices
    - In this section, you will need to use your research to highlight the features that are suitable to include in your project. You should explain why these features are important for your solution, considering the users and their needs.
    - Example
    - I will include a direct messaging feature in my project that allows users to chat with their friends in private. This is an essential feature, as it will allow students to socialise more effectively. For example, students will be able to use it to arrange to meet up.

## Initial concepts of the solution considering this research

My solution will be a mobile app that dedicated for attracting users to kept a healthy diet. 

The app will enable user to record their daily consumption of food either by selecting the food from the search bar or by scanning the barcode of the products, and the algorithm on the back ground will analyze the nutrition they consume in every meal, and based on it's statistic and other user data for example their location, the app can automatically recommend user with a selection meal that the user might like and should consume in order to pursue their healthy diet. Hence, a history view is required for user to check what they have consume before.

When facing the food that the database is not included, users will be able to add their own food to the database.

Furthermore, the app will visualize the boring statistical numbers to easy-to-understand colorful graphs and charts with animation. It will makes these information easier for users who're lack of basic knowledge about eating healthy to understand. 

The app will also synchronise data with apple's HealthKit to provide more accurate calories counter, also to provide interaction with other fitness apps.

Moreover, to attract the users kept using this app, the app will provide an online community which allows interaction happens between users. There will be a ranking leaderboard between the user and their friends. Users can see who is keeping on the track and who is having a "cheat day" directly. Also it provides article posting and sharing platform, where users can share there own thoughts about eating healthily. These kinds of function will allure user to maintain their interest about a healthy life-style constantly and on the other hand, it can also helps them building up their self-control ability.

This app will also provides a lot of useful little-tools to help user tracking their record:

- A nutrition calculator - User can input raw materials for making the meal, and the app will shows estimated nutrition data of the meal to user. User then can add this meal directly to their own customized food library.
- A volume estimator - User can use their mobile phone's camera to estimate the volume of their container of the food.

A login system is required for user the process should be encoded in order to provide security to user.

## Limitation of my solutions:

The main limitation of this solution will be that when users forgot to record their meal, the algorithm that recommends user meals will be inaccurate. Also, there's a large amount of foods out there, the app's database can only provide a "general" nutrition information for foods. It is unlikely to get every accurate data on every specific food. So the algorithm can only depends on this inaccurate data. The recommendation for user could be inaccurate.

Another limitation is about the food information database. As theres billions of type of food in the whole world. It is impossible to include every specific data of every type of food. So not every user's preference will be taken care by the algorithm. Especially when this app are released to foreign country with totally different culture, localization will be a extremely tough work.

The action for user to add their own food could be inaccurate when user provides inaccurate data. This will also affects the recommendation algorithm.
