# Software and Hardware Requirements

- DO's
    - [x]  Specify the success criteria(requirements) for your proposed solution
    - [x]  Do specify success criteria(requirements) that can be demonstrated through testing

- DON'Ts
    - Specify **vague subjective criteria**, such as colorful interface or easy or quick to use.

---

- OCR Criteria
    - Specified and justified the requirements for the solution including (as appropriate) any **hardware and soft ware requirements**
    - Identified and justified measurable **success criteria** for the proposed solution.

---

- ISSAC - Specify and justify the solution requirements, and the measurable success criteria for the proposed solution.
    - Objectives must be **SMART**
        - Specific
            - Each objective must be single purpose, and described clearly and with a level of detail that ensures unambiguity.
        - Measurable
            - An objective such as "The system must be fast" is not measurable. Instead, you could say, "100% of users must be happy with system response times". It is worth taking time to consider **how** you would measure something.
        - Achievable
        - Realistic
            - A realistic objective is one that fits well within the intended system. For example, it would not be realistic to expect a four-year-old to type text answers to written questions.
        - Timebound
            - There is a firm deadline by which you must meet these objectives, and that is the date given to you by your teacher.

    As well as being SMART, your specification must be detailed. Your objectives must specify what functionality is needed, but not how your technical solution will provide this functionality. For example, you could specify that "the system must store all attendance data" but not that "the system must use a MySQL database".

### Hardware and Software Requirements

- **An iPhone(after iPhone 6) or an iPad(after iPad Air 2)** is required for installing and testing this app. **The iPhone and iPad required have to run iOS13 or iPadOS13 operating system,** because the app will be build in the SwiftUI environment which only support iOS13 or newer operating system. That's the reason why only the iPhone(after iPhone 6) and the iPad(after iPad Air 2) is supported.
- **A smart watch or smart band** is preferred ed to test the connection among my app and other fitness app's data in order to provide more accurate calories counter.
- **A internet connection** is required to communicate with food database stored in the server.

## Success Criteria

The following points are success criteria which will make the system meets the goal set by my client, they are split into essential and desirable, essential is the main function that must be included in the app, and desirable is the harder function that I will try my best to achieve it within the time allowed.

## Essential
