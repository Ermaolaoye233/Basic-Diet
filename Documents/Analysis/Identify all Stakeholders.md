    问题2:您认为市面上的健康饮食记录App有什么缺陷吗（如果使用过的话）？

    问题5:您还希望这个App拥有什么功能？

    Question 5: What else function do you want to see in this app.

The clients and demographic for this app would be users who're interested to keep a healthy diet and a iOS device owner. The ranging of these user could be very wide: from people who has obesity and wants to lose weight, to professional bodybuilder who want a more efficient way to track their daily consumption. Hence, the stakeholders will be a representative sample.

I had pass out questionnaires on social platforms to select stakeholders based on their answers.

The questionnaires includes 7 question. There's 2 question about selecting types of food that is healthy. The range of food people can select have a lot of food that normally people think it is healthy however it is not, for example, soup. Another question required user to explain why they think the type of food they didn't choose is not healthy. I used this 2 question to classify people to different categories. For example, people who answer correctly and explain well will be grouped into the part of people that have basic understanding of healthy diet knowledge. The rest of the question asked user whether they had use similar app on the market or not, also asking them to offer their opinion towards those apps.

Hence, I choose my friend Amoran Huang, a 22-year-old female college student who is enthusiastic in gym-training, she's on a healthy diet for a long time and had very deep understanding of the healthy diet knowledge. I will choose her as a representative for professional bodybuilders.

Also my friend Zhenyao Lee, a 22-year-old female english teacher who does not went to gym frequently and want to lose weight, as a representative for people who want lower their weight by having a healthy diet.  

Moreover, my friend Ralston Zhao, a 18-year-old male college student who has some basic knowledge of healthy diet, but never tried to control his diet before. I will choose him as a representative for this kinds of people.

Furthermore, my aunt Xiaoli Cui, a 40-year-old female who only knew a little knowledge about healthy diet, and never went to workout. She has deep interest about learning the healthy diet style of living through this app and wishes this app can help her lose some weight.

I will interview them through WeChat, and target them as my end user. I'll ask them for ideas that will be useful to include in the app; then I will analyse the ideas and add them to the list of my Key Solution features, this will then allow the application to be appealing and fitting for my end user.
