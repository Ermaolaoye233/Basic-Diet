- CnD Advice **Defining the problem & the Stakeholder**
    - Start by giving a **brief background to the problem**. Answer the questions:
    - What is the company?
    What does the company do?
    Who are the stakeholders / end users?
    What problem do they have?
    How will they make sure of your proposed solution and why is it appropriate to their needs?
    - This initial description of the problem should be no more than a couple of paragraphs.
    - If you are writing a computer game, give a description of the type of game it is with a very brief explanation.
    Explain who will play the game and on what platform. Identify the key requirements outside the actual game play
    itself, e.g. in the case of a mobile phone game: easy to pick up and put down, pause at any point and continue
    later.
    - If the problem has already been solved, pretend you are solving it for a new platform or user. E.g. with space
    invaders, perhaps it is a mobile phone version or a new twist on the old concept.
    - Note about stakeholders: Make sure you clearly name all of the stakeholders / users for your system. These must
    be actual named individuals that you can have regular contact with as they will be required to give you feedback
    and interviews throughout the development of your project. You can have more than one stakeholder / user. For
    example if you are creating a Maths revision utility for 11 year olds then you would clearly have two users, a Maths
    teacher and an 11 year old students. They will both be able to give you requirements and feedback from their
    different perspective.
    - It is also acceptable to have chosen a “persona”, someone who personifies the typical user for your chosen system.
    This will be most likely if you choose to make a game. Decide who your game is targeted at e.g. “Teenagers into
    mobile gaming” and then choose a named person from this target group who you will be able to have regular
    contact with to act as your stakeholder / end user.
    - Make sure in this section to not just simply list our users / stakeholders. For top marks you must make sure to
    explain how they will make sure of your proposed solution and explain why it is suitable for their needs.

## Problem Identification

- Draft Bullet Points
    - MAIN PROBLEM:
        - Users are not self-controlled enough to use these app.
        - The app on the market is not **smart** enough.
    - NO app can recommend you healthy food based on your consuming history.
    - NO app can automatically adjust the amount of nutrition you should take in based on your consuming history(you eat less healthy today, you have to eat more healthy tomorrow or within the week).
    - Most people are too lazy to use the apps that track their diet on the market.
    - This app can combine these two function trying to allure the users kept tracking their diet to be more **self-controlled**.
        - E.g. If I behave good for a couple of day(I eat enough nutrition every day, didn't eat too much unhealthy food), the app might reward me a "Cheat Meal". So I can eat in a little unhealthy way in that particular meal.
        - Also, the app will include user interaction with their friends. For example, the app might provide a user ranking with all their friends. So the user can see how much their friends contribute to the healthy diet(working out more, or eating enough nutrition).

According to the *Statistics on Obesity, Physical Activity and Diet, England, 2020* report, published by the NHS, 67% of men and 60% of women in England are overweight or obese. The World Health Organisation had estimated that there are at least 2.8 million of people who because of obesity and the decease caused by obesity. 

As the health risk brought by overweight has attract people's attention, more and more people had start trying to change their way of living in order to getting healthier. Keeping a healthy diet takes a huge part in the healthy living trend. However, for most of the people who're lack of the self-control ability, it is tough for them to keep a good diet.

Hence, I decide to create a mobile app, dedicated for attracting users to kept a healthy diet as a solution to this problem. The app will track user's daily meal consumption, analyze the nutrition they consume every meal, and based on it's statistic, the app can automatically recommend user with the meal that the user should consume in order to pursue their healthy diet. Moreover, to attract the users kept using this app, the app will provide interaction between users function, for example, a ranking leaderboard between the user and their friends. Users can see who is keeping on the track and who is having a "cheat day" directly. These kinds of function will allure user to maintain their interest about a healthy life-style constantly and on the other hand, it can also helps them building up their self-control ability.
