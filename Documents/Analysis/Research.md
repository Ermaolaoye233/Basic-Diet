### Existing Similar Solution

#### My FitnessPal

**Overview**

![Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2845.png](Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2845.png)

My FitnessPal is the world's most popular calories counter(based on the statistical data given by its developer), they have about 88% of their member tracks their diet and exercise for at least 7 days on MyFitnessPal to lose weight.

It provides a large database for different types of foods and exercises. Users can add their record by clicking the big "+" button at the bottom of the screen. The app also automatically synchronised with the apple's own health app's data. This makes the app able to read data from other app that also synchronised their data with apple's health app. For example, I can use Nike Run Club app to track my running, while using my apple watch to track my daily workouts, eventually all the data will automatically being read by My FitnessPal and being calculated as a part of Calories Burn.

![Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2848.png](Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2848.png)

It only provides very little amount of data visualization. Most of the data is still being shown in numbers. This can easily confused people, especially in food description menu.

![Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2851.png](Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2851.png)

It provides pre-built "plans" for eating healthy, however, it is not customized for every user. User have to select one of the pre-built "plans" which might not fit their personal preference.

 

It have too many advertisement.

**Parts that I can apply to my solution:**

The nutrition data from this app is precise and professional, I should use similar data sheet in my app's database.

It reads health data from apple's native HealthKit, I should also include similar function, in order to communicate data with other apps that user might use. Also, It use exercise data as a part of calculation the calories counter

It offers a variety of plans for user to select, this makes user have more option. I should make my own algorithm to offer more selection of healthy meals.

### Lose It!

**Overview**

Lose It! is also a diet tracker from FitNow. It have over 40 millions of users. It also provides a large size food nutrition information database just like My FitnessPal. However, it provides a more precise visualisation of the statistical data for food nutrition.

![Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2858.png](Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2858.png)

![Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2853.png](Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2853.png)

This makes users easier to understand what they had taken in with the meal.

It also provides a twitter-like online community where users can post messages on it.

![Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2855.png](Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2855.png)

However, the online community seems provide too complicated function that is not appropriate for an health tracker app. Moreover, even they had over 40 millions of users, there's barely any user used this community function frequently.

![Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2859.png](Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2859.png)

The app also post articles about healthy diet and exercises, offering useful healthy knowledge to user.

**Parts that I can apply to my solution:**

I should include the article sharing function to my app. Users can write and post articles about healthy diet in the community. This can enable users to share healthy tips between each other, also making them feeling more engaged within the community.

### Mint Health

**Overview**

- Another Chinese diet tracking app
- Clear UI with efficient Visualization
- Dynamic Animation attracts users
- Community but too many functions
- Online shop that sells products
- Provide easy estimation of food quantity based on sizes.

Mint Health is an fitness app that focus on the Mainland China market. It is just like Lose It! that provides a online community among users. It also provides other more commercial functions like an online shopping platform, and a online medication platform.

![Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2860.png](Research%204a69abc7d20f4030804a4c93a70b232d/IMG_2860.png)

The app provides a clear visualization of the nutrition data with colors on every statistic number.

**Parts that I can apply to my solution:**

I should visualize the boring statistical data clearly in my app just like Mint Health, to make user have a better understanding of what they should eat and what they should not.

I can also build commercial functions in it, like provide native super-link to other online shopping platform for example Amazon, to let user buy the food and healthy product directly.

### TikTok

TikTok is a online short-video social platform that has over 700 million users world wide within only less than four years of existence.

TikTok have one of the best user persona identification algorithm. It is an algorithm that classifying users depends on what video they had view, and their location, their social connection with their friends. After grouping users and attach them with "tags", the app automatically recommend videos to users and there's a highly chance that they will be enjoying to watch.

**Parts that I can apply to my solution:**

Although the persona identification algorithm that TikTok use is privately within the company, there's still a lot of other recommendation algorithm in the market that is open source and I should pay attention to them.
