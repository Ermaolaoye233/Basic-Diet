## Problem Identification

- Draft Bullet Points
    - MAIN PROBLEM:
        - Users are not self-controlled enough to use these app.
        - The app on the market is not **smart** enough.
    - NO app can recommend you healthy food based on your consuming history.
    - NO app can automatically adjust the amount of nutrition you should take in based on your consuming history(you eat less healthy today, you have to eat more healthy tomorrow or within the week).
    - Most people are too lazy to use the apps that track their diet on the market.
    - This app can combine these two function trying to allure the users kept tracking their diet to be more **self-controlled**.
        - E.g. If I behave good for a couple of day(I eat enough nutrition every day, didn't eat too much unhealthy food), the app might reward me a "Cheat Meal". So I can eat in a little unhealthy way in that particular meal.
        - Also, the app will include user interaction with their friends. For example, the app might provide a user ranking with all their friends. So the user can see how much their friends contribute to the healthy diet(working out more, or eating enough nutrition).

According to the *Statistics on Obesity, Physical Activity and Diet, England, 2020* report, published by the NHS, 67% of men and 60% of women in England are overweight or obese. The World Health Organisation had estimated that there are at least 2.8 million of people who because of obesity and the decease caused by obesity. 

As the health risk brought by overweight has attract people's attention, more and more people had start trying to change their way of living in order to getting healthier. Keeping a healthy diet takes a huge part in the healthy living trend. However, for most of the people who're lack of the self-control ability, it is tough for them to keep a good diet.

Hence, I decide to create a mobile app, dedicated for attracting users to kept a healthy diet as a solution to this problem. The app will track user's daily meal consumption, analyze the nutrition they consume every meal, and based on it's statistic, the app can automatically recommend user with the meal that the user should consume in order to pursue their healthy diet. Moreover, to attract the users kept using this app, the app will provide interaction between users function, for example, a ranking leaderboard between the user and their friends. Users can see who is keeping on the track and who is having a "cheat day" directly. These kinds of function will allure user to maintain their interest about a healthy life-style constantly and on the other hand, it can also helps them building up their self-control ability.



# Identify all the stakeholders

The clients and demographic for this app would be users who're interested to keep a healthy diet and a iOS device owner. The ranging of these user could be very wide: from people who has obesity and wants to lose weight, to professional bodybuilder who want a more efficient way to track their daily consumption. Hence, the stakeholders will be a representative sample.

I had pass out questionnaires on social platforms to select stakeholders based on their answers.

The questionnaires includes 7 question. There's 2 question about selecting types of food that is healthy. The range of food people can select have a lot of food that normally people think it is healthy however it is not, for example, soup. Another question required user to explain why they think the type of food they didn't choose is not healthy. I used this 2 question to classify people to different categories. For example, people who answer correctly and explain well will be grouped into the part of people that have basic understanding of healthy diet knowledge. The rest of the question asked user whether they had use similar app on the market or not, also asking them to offer their opinion towards those apps.

Hence, I choose my friend Amoran Huang, a 22-year-old female college student who is enthusiastic in gym-training, she's on a healthy diet for a long time and had very deep understanding of the healthy diet knowledge. I will choose her as a representative for professional bodybuilders.

Also my friend Zhenyao Lee, a 22-year-old female english teacher who does not went to gym frequently and want to lose weight, as a representative for people who want lower their weight by having a healthy diet.  

Moreover, my friend Ralston Zhao, a 18-year-old male college student who has some basic knowledge of healthy diet, but never tried to control his diet before. I will choose him as a representative for this kinds of people.

Furthermore, my aunt Xiaoli Cui, a 40-year-old female who only knew a little knowledge about healthy diet, and never went to workout. She has deep interest about learning the healthy diet style of living through this app and wishes this app can help her lose some weight.

I will interview them through WeChat, and target them as my end user. I'll ask them for ideas that will be useful to include in the app; then I will analyse the ideas and add them to the list of my Key Solution features, this will then allow the application to be appealing and fitting for my end user.

### **Interview**

**Interview Questions**

I will outline some of the key question that I will ask each type of stakeholder, but during the interview I may ask follow up questions depends on their answers. The questions will find out their opinion on the software and how would they think the software can help them to change their diet.

**Ralston Zhao**

My question for Ralston(represent people who have basic knowledge about eating healthy but never tried on a healthy diet before) are as follows:

- **Question 1**: What do you think is the most difficult part for staying a healthy diet.
- **Question 2**: Do you think the health tracker app on the market have any drawbacks
- I will explain to him the basic function of my solution.
- **Question 3**: Do you think an app with these function will be able to attract you to keep a healthy diet?
- **Question 4**: What do you think about recommending food by Artificial Intelligence depends on your food preferences?
- **Question 5**: What else function do you want to see in this app.

Question 1 establish his experience about healthy diet. This is important since I will be able to know his weakness, and I can use my solution's function to solve his problem.

Question 2 finds out his experience about the existing health tracker app in the market and his opinion towards those app.

After explaining to him my solution towards the problem, I will use Question 3 to get his opinion about my solution. Also using question 4 to know how well he can accept the food recommended by a computer.

I will use Question 5 to get information about any new function he might think is useful for solving his problems about eating healthy.

**Zhenyao Lee and Xiaoli Cui**

My question for Zhenyao and Xiaoli(represents people who want to lose weight and learn some basic healthy eating knowledge by using this app) are as follows:

- **Question 1**: What do you think is the most difficult part for you to lose weight?
- **Question 2**: What do you think is the most difficult part for staying a healthy diet?
- **Question 3**: Do you think the health tracker app on the market have any drawbacks?
- I will explain to him the basic function of my solution.
- **Question 4:** Do you think an app with these function will be able to attract you to keep a healthy diet and loose weight?
- **Question 5:** What do you think about recommending food by Artificial Intelligence depends on your food preferences?
- **Question 6**: What else function do you want to see in this app?

Question 1 and 2 establish their expereicne about healthy diet and loosing weight. I can identify their weakness and use my solution's functions to solve their problem.

Question 3 finds out their experience about the existing health tracker app in the market and their opinion towards those app.

After explaining to them my solution towards the problem, I will use Question 4 to get their opinion about my solution and whether do they think my solution will help them loose weight or not. Also using question 5 to know how well they can accept the food recommended by a computer.

I will use Question 6 to get information about any new function they might think is useful for solving their problems about eating healthy and loose weight.

**Amoran Huang**

My question for Amoran Huang(represents professional trainer and people who already get used to eating healthily for long time) are the same as the questions that I asked ralston. However I will also ask her these additional questions:

- **Question 6**: As a professional trainer and people who eat healthy for quite a long time, what function do you think can improve the professionalism of this app?



# Computational Methods that can applied to this problem

Before the creation of diet tracking app, people can only record their meal by writing notes and diaries. It is not convenient as they have to brought a notebook with them all the time, and remembering all the nutrition information for every type of food is too hard for human-being. 

Hence, an mobile app with up-to-date nutrition database is a efficient and convenient solution to this problem. As the computer can store and calculate large amount of nutrition data in a very short time. Also it can analysis the data and provides user with statistical graphs to make the boring number more appealing for user to understand.

### Problem Recognition

The main problem is building an diet tracking app that can attract users to keep using it by recommending dishes based on their consuming history and visualize statistical healthy data to show user their current health information also providing interaction between users to let them engaged in this healthy diet society. In other words, creates an database on a server that save a variety of information of different kinds of foods and held user information; creates an algorithm that is able to automatically recommend optimal dishes to user based on their consumption history stored in the database and their location or other personal information; creates an online community among users.

### Problem Decomposition

Each part of this problem can be decomposed into a set of smaller steps.

- **Tracking Diet**:
  1. User select what food they had eat in that meal from the food information database.
  2. The app calculate the amount of nutrition the user had taken in.
  3. The app save the record to user's database, and visualize the numbers in statistical graphs to user.
- **Recommending Meals**:
  1. The app reads the user persona profile from user's database.
  2. The app using an algorithm to analysis the persona profile, and the amount of nutrition the user had taken in within a few days.
  3. The app then gives user recommendation of foods that they might like and will fit their healthy diet.
- **Interactive Community**:
  1. Users can leave comments on foods in the food description.
  2. The comments will be saved in the online database.
  3. Users can add each other's account to becomes "friends"
  4. The app will provide an ranking among friends, to let users see how their friends has contribute to healthy diet.

By broken down the whole complex problem into these subroutines, it reduce the complexity of the program.

### Divide and Conquer

Each small part of these problems can be solved on their own and combined together into a modular program, like database module, online communication module, hence make use of the divide and conquer method of problem solving. This will greatly simplifies very complex problems.

### Abstraction

Using levels of abstraction allows splitting the complex problem and its functionality to simpler components part.

## Existing Similar Solution

### My FitnessPal

**Overview**

![Research%20188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2845.png](/Users/huangzihang/SynologyDrive/Developer/A-Level/Project/Basic Diet/Documents/NotionDocumentsBackup/Research 188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2845.png)

My FitnessPal is the world's most popular calories counter(based on the statistical data given by its developer), they have about 88% of their member tracks their diet and exercise for at least 7 days on MyFitnessPal to lose weight.

It provides a large database for different types of foods and exercises. Users can add their record by clicking the big "+" button at the bottom of the screen. The app also automatically synchronised with the apple's own health app's data. This makes the app able to read data from other app that also synchronised their data with apple's health app. For example, I can use Nike Run Club app to track my running, while using my apple watch to track my daily workouts, eventually all the data will automatically being read by My FitnessPal and being calculated as a part of Calories Burn.

![Research%20188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2849.png](/Users/huangzihang/SynologyDrive/Developer/A-Level/Project/Basic Diet/Documents/NotionDocumentsBackup/Research 188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2849.png)

![Research%20188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2848.png](/Users/huangzihang/SynologyDrive/Developer/A-Level/Project/Basic Diet/Documents/NotionDocumentsBackup/Research 188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2848.png)

It only provides very little amount of data visualization. Most of the data is still being shown in numbers. This can easily confused people, especially in food description menu.

![Research%20188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2851.png](/Users/huangzihang/SynologyDrive/Developer/A-Level/Project/Basic Diet/Documents/NotionDocumentsBackup/Research 188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2851.png)

![Research%20188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2852.png](/Users/huangzihang/SynologyDrive/Developer/A-Level/Project/Basic Diet/Documents/NotionDocumentsBackup/Research 188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2852.png)

It provides pre-built "plans" for eating healthy, however, it is not customized for every user. User have to select one of the pre-built "plans" which might not fit their personal preference.

 

It have too many advertisement.

**Parts that I can apply to my solution:**

The nutrition data from this app is precise and professional, I should use similar data sheet in my app's database.

It reads health data from apple's native HealthKit, I should also include similar function, in order to communicate data with other apps that user might use. Also, It use exercise data as a part of calculation the calories counter

It offers a variety of plans for user to select, this makes user have more option. I should make my own algorithm to offer more selection of healthy meals.

### Lose It!

**Overview**

Lose It! is also a diet tracker from FitNow. It have over 40 millions of users. It also provides a large size food nutrition information database just like My FitnessPal. However, it provides a more precise visualisation of the statistical data for food nutrition.

![Research%20188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2858.png](/Users/huangzihang/SynologyDrive/Developer/A-Level/Project/Basic Diet/Documents/NotionDocumentsBackup/Research 188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2858.png)

![Research%20188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2853.png](/Users/huangzihang/SynologyDrive/Developer/A-Level/Project/Basic Diet/Documents/NotionDocumentsBackup/Research 188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2853.png)

This makes users easier to understand what they had taken in with the meal.

It also provides a twitter-like online community where users can post messages on it.

![Research%20188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2855.png](/Users/huangzihang/SynologyDrive/Developer/A-Level/Project/Basic Diet/Documents/NotionDocumentsBackup/Research 188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2855.png)

However, the online community seems provide too complicated function that is not appropriate for an health tracker app. Moreover, even they had over 40 millions of users, there's barely any user used this community function frequently.

![Research%20188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2859.png](/Users/huangzihang/SynologyDrive/Developer/A-Level/Project/Basic Diet/Documents/NotionDocumentsBackup/Research 188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2859.png)

The app also post articles about healthy diet and exercises, offering useful healthy knowledge to user.

**Parts that I can apply to my solution:**

I should include the article sharing function to my app. Users can write and post articles about healthy diet in the community. This can enable users to share healthy tips between each other, also making them feeling more engaged within the community.

### Mint Health

**Overview**

- Another Chinese diet tracking app
- Clear UI with efficient Visualization
- Dynamic Animation attracts users
- Community but too many functions
- Online shop that sells products
- Provide easy estimation of food quantity based on sizes.

Mint Health is an fitness app that focus on the Mainland China market. It is just like Lose It! that provides a online community among users. It also provides other more commercial functions like an online shopping platform, and a online medication platform.

![Research%20188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2860.png](/Users/huangzihang/SynologyDrive/Developer/A-Level/Project/Basic Diet/Documents/NotionDocumentsBackup/Research 188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2860.png)

![Research%20188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2901.png](/Users/huangzihang/SynologyDrive/Developer/A-Level/Project/Basic Diet/Documents/NotionDocumentsBackup/Research 188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2901.png)

The app provides a clear visualization of the nutrition data with colors on every statistic number.

![Research%20188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2899.png](/Users/huangzihang/SynologyDrive/Developer/A-Level/Project/Basic Diet/Documents/NotionDocumentsBackup/Research 188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/IMG_2899.png)

**Parts that I can apply to my solution:**

I should visualize the boring statistical data clearly in my app just like Mint Health, to make user have a better understanding of what they should eat and what they should not.

I can also build commercial functions in it, like provide native super-link to other online shopping platform for example Amazon, to let user buy the food and healthy product directly.

### TikTok

TikTok is a online short-video social platform that has over 700 million users world wide within only less than four years of existence.

TikTok have one of the best user persona identification algorithm. It is an algorithm that classifying users depends on what video they had view, and their location, their social connection with their friends. After grouping users and attach them with "tags", the app automatically recommend videos to users and there's a highly chance that they will be enjoying to watch.

[Research%20188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/025-__2_4x.png.webp](Research%20188a3ebae09c4368a8c380aa68987fe4/025-__2_4x.png.webp)

**Parts that I can apply to my solution:**

Although the persona identification algorithm that TikTok use is privately within the company, there's still a lot of other recommendation algorithm in the market that is open source and I should pay attention to them.



# Features of the proposed solution

## Initial concepts of the solution considering this research

My solution will be a mobile app that dedicated for attracting users to kept a healthy diet. 

The app will enable user to record their daily consumption of food either by selecting the food from the search bar or by scanning the barcode of the products, and the algorithm on the back ground will analyze the nutrition they consume in every meal, and based on it's statistic and other user data for example their location, the app can automatically recommend user with a selection meal that the user might like and should consume in order to pursue their healthy diet. Hence, a history view is required for user to check what they have consume before.

When facing the food that the database is not included, users will be able to add their own food to the database.

Furthermore, the app will visualize the boring statistical numbers to easy-to-understand colorful graphs and charts with animation. It will makes these information easier for users who're lack of basic knowledge about eating healthy to understand. 

The app will also synchronise data with apple's HealthKit to provide more accurate calories counter, also to provide interaction with other fitness apps.

Moreover, to attract the users kept using this app, the app will provide an online community which allows interaction happens between users. There will be a ranking leaderboard between the user and their friends. Users can see who is keeping on the track and who is having a "cheat day" directly. Also it provides article posting and sharing platform, where users can share there own thoughts about eating healthily. These kinds of function will allure user to maintain their interest about a healthy life-style constantly and on the other hand, it can also helps them building up their self-control ability.

This app will also provides a lot of useful little-tools to help user tracking their record:

- A nutrition calculator - User can input raw materials for making the meal, and the app will shows estimated nutrition data of the meal to user. User then can add this meal directly to their own customized food library.
- A volume estimator - User can use their mobile phone's camera to estimate the volume of their container of the food.

A login system is required for user the process should be encoded in order to provide security to user.

## Limitation of my solutions:

The main limitation of this solution will be that when users forgot to record their meal, the algorithm that recommends user meals will be inaccurate. Also, there's a large amount of foods out there, the app's database can only provide a "general" nutrition information for foods. It is unlikely to get every accurate data on every specific food. So the algorithm can only depends on this inaccurate data. The recommendation for user could be inaccurate.

Another limitation is about the food information database. As theres billions of type of food in the whole world. It is impossible to include every specific data of every type of food. So not every user's preference will be taken care by the algorithm. Especially when this app are released to foreign country with totally different culture, localization will be a extremely tough work.

The action for user to add their own food could be inaccurate when user provides inaccurate data. This will also affects the recommendation algorithm.

# Hardware and Software Requirements

- **An iPhone(after iPhone 6) or an iPad(after iPad Air 2)** is required for installing and testing this app. **The iPhone and iPad required have to run iOS13 or iPadOS13 operating system,** because the app will be build in the SwiftUI environment which only support iOS13 or newer operating system. That's the reason why only the iPhone(after iPhone 6) and the iPad(after iPad Air 2) is supported.
- **A smart watch or smart band** is preferred ed to test the connection among my app and other fitness app's data in order to provide more accurate calories counter.
- **A internet connection** is required to communicate with food database stored in the server.

## Success Criteria

The following points are success criteria which will make the system meets the goal set by my client, they are split into essential and desirable, essential is the main function that must be included in the app, and desirable is the harder function that I will try my best to achieve it within the time allowed.

[Essential](https://www.notion.so/71b73a6d09e442ccad933f5cae306652)

[Desirable](https://www.notion.so/31ab62940c1041708a6ae8b635dcdf46)
